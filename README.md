<h1> The avali origin </h1>
  
  <p> The Avali are a race of Space Bird-Rapters originally made by RyuujinZERO using the video game SPORE, and later made into a mod for Starbound.
    Only, one of the most popular games ever, Minecraft, did not have them.
    So I fixed that.</p>

    <h2>Static Powers</h2>
  <p> First features first, the standard buffs and debuffs. Let's get this over with, so what we can get to the fun stuff.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      Smaller
    </dt>
    <dd>
      You're as small as a dime, cute as a button! Sadly, this comes with some... downgrades in your physical ablitys. Nothing that your pack and some cybernetics can't help with! (NOTE: These modifiers are applied first before all other stat changes)
      <ul>
        <li>
          -50% max HP
        </li>
        <li>
          -20% atk damage
        </li>
        <li>
          +20% movement speed
        </li>
        <li>
          67% the size of a normal player
        </li>
        <li>
          Anything above chainmail is too heavy for your small body
        </li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Sensitive ears
    </dt>
    <dd>
      You can easily hear players that move around you! And, you can differentiate from the amount of players that are there! (Allows you to know the exact amount of players that are moving near you)
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Sensitive eyes
    </dt>
    <dd>
      They may not see well, but they can pick up even the slightest bits of light!
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Musical
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Like all Avali, you love music! So much so, that it helps you work harder, and get more done!   
      When within 10 blocks of a jukebox playing music:
      <ul>
        <li>
          +50% attack damage
        </li>
        <li>
          +10% movement speed
        </li>
        <li>
          +100% dig speed
        </li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>
      Freezing homelands
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Avali are naturally cold, so it only makes sense you'd spawn in the Snowy Taiga!
    </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Packs</h2>
    <p> Alright, now that that's over with, lets get to the fun stuff!</p>
    <p> First off are the packs, Press your key.saveToolbarActivator while looking at another player (They don't have to be an avali) to ask them to join your pack! Here's a list of effects the status of your pack will have on you as an Avali:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      Power in numbers
    </dt>
  <dd>
    Your pack mates are your best friends, and you do everything so much better when your doing it with them! When within 32 blocks of a member of the same pack:
    <ul>
      <li>
        +100% max HP
      </li>
      <li>
        +30% atk Damage
      </li>
      <li>
        +10% movement speed
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Safety in numbers
  </dt>
  <dd>
    You hold a special connection with your pack, and are looking out for their safty no matter where they are! No matter how far away you are from them, if they get hurt, you'll know about it! [NOTE: If eggolib is installed, your pack mate will also glow to other avali of the same pack for a short while.]
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Lonelyness...
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Without a proper pack you feel so... alone... (Packs consist of at least 3 members and a max of 6 members) If you do not have a large enough pack:
    <ul>
      <li>
        -20% max HP
      </li>
      <li>
        -20% Attack dmg
      </li>
      <li>
        -20% Movement speed
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Sadness
  </dt>
  <dd>
    When a pack member dies, you can't help but feel an empty feeling in your stomach. You know they'll come back, but that still doesn't change what happened. For 1 minute after a pack member dies:
    <ul>
      <li>
        -10% Max HP
      </li>
      <li>
        -10% Attack dmg
      </li>
      <li>
        -10% movement speed
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Pack loss
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Sometimes a pack member leaves the pack. This inflicts an Avali with pack loss, which is basically Avali depression. Until you get a new pack member:
    <ul>
      <li>
        -10% Max HP
      </li>
      <li>
        -10% Atk Damage
      </li>
      <li>
        -10% movement speed
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <p> It's generally a good idea to stay with your pack, that way you get more buffs, and you can help them out if need be.</p>
  <h2> Cybernetics</h2>
  <p> Avalis love their cybernetics, and that doesn't change here! Although your selection is limited, there are still a few cybernetics you can craft in attempt to overcome your shortfallings! Side note: Teir 1 and 2 do not stack. IE: if teir 1 gives +5 max hp, and teir 2 give +10, when having both you will only have +10 max HP, since Teir two cancels out Teir one</p>
